# Gig Counter
Apple Watch app to help gig economy workers set and track daily earnings goals.

Worn on wrist, Uber drivers/DoorDash delivereres/etc. can easily set an earnings goal for each day.
They can easily track $$$ earned throughout the day, and see how much they need to make in order to
meet their goal.

Daily Goal Tracker branch adds functionality to generalize goal to any units... Calls, situps, and of course $$$. Adds iPhone Companion app to set format and units.
